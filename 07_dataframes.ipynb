    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces Pandas, which is a powerful library for working with data.  Pandas provides functions for reading data from files, and it provides two new types for working with data, DataFrames and Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use these tools to estimate the average birth weight of babies in the U.S.  This example demonstrates the important steps in almost any data science project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifying data that can answer a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Obtaining the data and loading it in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Checking the data and dealing with errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Selecting the relevant subsets from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using histograms to visualize a distribution of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Using summary statistics to describe the data in a way that best answers the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Considering possible sources of error and limitations in our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this notebook presents a data science project from end to end, it is a little longer than some of the previous notebooks.  So, hang in there!"

    "The fundamental goal of data science is to use data to answer questions and guide decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we'll start with a simple question: what is the average birth weight of babies in the United States?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer a question like this, we have to find an appropriate dataset or run an experiment to collect it.  Then we have to get the data into our development environment and prepare it for analysis, which involves cleaning and validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this question we'll use data from the [National Survey of Family Growth](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm), which is available from the National Center for Health Statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their 2013-2015 dataset includes information about a sample of women in the U.S. and their children.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python library we'll use to read and analyze data is Pandas, which we'll import as `pd`."
